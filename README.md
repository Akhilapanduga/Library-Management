# Library-Management System
This is a simple RESTful API for managing a library system. It allows basic CRUD operations on books and interacts with a MySQL database.

## Installation
1.Clone repository<br>
`git clone https://github.com/Akhilapanduga/library-management-system.git`

2.Database setup:<br>
Create a MySQL database named library with a table named as info containing columns id (set as the primary key), Book, and Author to prevent the insertion of duplicate data based on the unique id values.<br>
Import the library.sql file to seed the database with the necessary table.

3.Web Server Setup:<br>
Ensure you have a web server (like Apache) set up to serve the PHP files.

4.Configuration:<br>
Update database connection details in insert.php, search.php, and update.php with your MySQL credentials as follows.<br>
$host = "your-host";<br>
$user = "your-username";<br>
$pass = "your-password";<br>
$db = "library";

## Run the application
start web server and open the application in your browser<br>
`(http://localhost/path-to-your-project)`

## Database seeding
To seed the database with mock data, execute the following SQL queries:<br>

1. Open your MySQL client and connect to the database.<br>
2. Copy and paste the following SQL queries and execute them:<br>

sql<br>
 Insert sample books<br>
INSERT INTO info (id, Book, Author) VALUES<br>
(1, 'Book 1', 'Author 1'),<br>
(2, 'Book 2', 'Author 2'),<br>
 ... add more books as needed;<br>
